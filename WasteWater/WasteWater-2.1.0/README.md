# WasteWater

Free library for modelling and simulation of waste water treatment plants.

## Library description

The package WasteWater provides a collection of 3 different
international accepted *a*ctivated *s*ludge *m*odels (ASM) of different complexity,
including models for preclarifiers and 5 different models for
the secondary settling process.

PS: SimulationTimeUnit for all models built with the WasteWater library is days [d].

The WasteWater package currently consists of the following subpackages

* ASM1 - Activated Sludge Model No.1  (models 13 wastewater components and 8 biological processes)
* ASM2d - Activated sludge Model No.2d (models 19 wastewater components and 21 biological processes)
* ASM3 - Activated Sludge Model No.3  (models 13 wastewater components and 12 biological processes)
* Icons - Icon definitions for wastewater treatment components
* WasteWaterUnits - unit type definitions for use with the WasteWater library
